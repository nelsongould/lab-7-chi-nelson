```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This: I'm Nelson and I am updating this markdown file here.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")

```

We are asking: Is there a significant difference in recommended gun control action for male and female respondents (should guns be easier, harder, or the same difficulty to get)?

Nelson: Data wrangling and counts

```{r}

get_guns <- gc_df %>% 
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>% 
  count(gender, make_get_guns) %>% 
  spread(make_get_guns, n) %>% 
  select(-gender) 

rownames(get_guns) <- c("Female","Male")



```
